# Topineur Language Guide

The original Lisp reference has been replaced by the Topineur specification. For the complete description of syntax, semantics, and tooling, consult the documents under `docs/topineur/`.

Recommended reading order:

1. `docs/topineur/overview.rst` — motivation and design pillars.
2. `docs/topineur/grammar.rst` — formal grammar (BNF).
3. `docs/topineur/language_reference.rst` — types, expressions, objects, traits.
4. `docs/topineur/user_manual.rst` — hands-on guide with examples.
5. `docs/topineur/security_review.rst` — analysis of type/effect/linearity guarantees.

Example programs live in `examples/topineur/` and are designed to match the user manual sections.
