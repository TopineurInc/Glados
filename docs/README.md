# Documentation Map

The documentation now mirrors the Topineur-first toolchain. Start with:

- **Architecture overview** → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`  
  Current frontend pipeline and migration roadmap for the backend.
- **Language guide** → `docs/LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md`  
  Pointers into the Topineur specifications (`docs/topineur/`).
- **Core IR & runtime roadmap** → `docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
  Status of the backend redesign and links to IR docs.
- **Developer workflow** → `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`  
  Build commands, CLI usage, and migration-era guidelines.

The in-depth specifications (grammar, user manual, compilation plan, security review) live under `docs/topineur/`.
