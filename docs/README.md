# Documentation Map

We rebuilt the documentation from scratch so it matches what you actually touch day to day. Follow the trail that fits what you need:

- **Project architecture** → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`  
  How the compiler and VM are split, what each pass produces, and where to tweak them.
- **Language guide** → `docs/LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md`  
  Paradigms, formal grammar (EBNF), evaluation rules, and everyday syntax/builtins for the Lisp dialect.
- **Bytecode & runtime reference** → `docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
  Instruction set, calling convention, frame layout, and how closures behave at runtime.
- **Developer workflow** → `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`  
  Building with `stack`, running the tests, debugging tips, and extending the project.

If you only have two minutes, read the first two sections of the architecture doc to get the big picture, then skim the language guide for syntax reminders.
